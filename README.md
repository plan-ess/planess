# Ironhack Project : "PlanEss" by Josue Prieto-Paz & Alan Sanchez

<br><br>

## About us
<br>
We are students in Ironhack Berlin's Web Dev Bootcamp.
For this project, the task was to create an MERN Web App from scratch.
<br>

## About "PlanEss"
<br>
This app was created to make Grocery Shopping easier. You can share the list of items your Household needs, with all of your roommates.
<br>
Once you create a User, you need to select JOIN or CREATE a Household, to start editing your Grocery List. 
You can add, modify or delete Items from the Household's shopping list, and edit your profile information.
There's also a new feature to filter to show only the URGENT items needed in your house!.
